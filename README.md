# alexa-skill-exchange-calculator
custom nodejs alexa skill with 3rd party API connection to calculate USD/EUR to TRY on amazon alexa devices. runs on amazon lambda with nodejs 6.10
this is not using alexa-sdk. I recommend to [continue with alexa-sdk version.](https://github.com/eercanayar/alexa-skill-exchange-calculator-sdk)

This skill have only feature that connects another API and gets and uses the data on it.
